# Help and support

GOV.UK Vue is built and maintained by [Matt Eason](https://github.com/matteason).

GOV.UK Vue is a community resource of the GOV.UK Design System. The Design System team is not
responsible for it and cannot support you with using it.
Contact me directly if you need help or you want to request a feature:

- [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/govuk-vue/govuk-vue/issues), if you think there's a bug in GOV.UK Vue, a problem with this documentation or you have a feature request
- [start a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/govuk-vue/govuk-vue/discussions), if you have any other questions or problems
- [message @matteason.me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matteason.me)
- [email govukvue@matteason.co.uk](mailto:govukvue@matteason.co.uk)

Even if you don't have any issues, I'd love to hear how you're using GOV.UK Vue.
